Implementation of [Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting/quilting.pdf) (Efros & Freeman, 2001) for CSCI 1430

# Credits

This project is aimed effectively blending tilings of arbitrary textures, hence we use images from a variety of sources. Credit for these textures (housed under `textures/`) is attributed to free and non-commercial use repositories, including: [texturelib](http://texturelib.com/) (TL), [Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/) (PB), and others as noted.
